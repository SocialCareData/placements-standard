# Placements Data Standard

Status: v2
Effective Date: 2025-07-18

## Purpose  

This Placement Standard will standardise some of the data collected about children in care at the point they are referred for placement and the point where a placement is agreed. The goal of this standard is to support better analysis of placement sufficiency at the local and regional level, tackle high costs in the care market and improve outcomes for children in care.

## Scope  

**The standard would help LAs:**  

* Better understand placement sufficiency: what provision is needed where, and at what notice    
* Speak the same data ‘language’ as neighbours to form regional view of sufficiency gaps    
* Distinguish between different drivers of placement costs (e.g. escalating need, displacement from foster to residential, increased referrals etc)    
* Make like-for-like comparisons of placement cost    
* Forecast future demand for different placement types  

**It will be designed to:**  

* Create the smallest possible burden on frontline staff   
* Minimise the amount of change required by LAs for adoption   
* Make use of existing data being gathered  

**The standard will *not*:**  

* Preclude LAs from gathering additional data fields to suit local needs   
* Impose a process for how the data is gathered in each LA (i.e. some LAs may embed these fields in a CMS referral form, others may gather this in excel etc)    
* Be designed with the purpose of supporting home search    
* Establish a national contract for placements   
* Establish a standard referral form    
* Mandate architecture or functionality changes for CMS suppliers

## Key assumptions  

There are a number of assumptions we have made in the design of the proposed data standard. We assume:  

* Placement teams rather than social workers or finance teams will either directly enter or ‘own’ the data being proposed in the standard. Where they are not directly entering the data (e.g. because they are taking it from a referral form), they would be responsible for its fidelity to the standard
* The additional work for a placement worker of entering this data is approximately 90 seconds (based on initial pilots of this data model) 
* While total cost agreed at IPA is often an inaccurate representation of true cost, it is ‘accurate enough’ to enable useful life-for-like cost comparisons and regional cost analysis.
