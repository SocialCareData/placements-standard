## Problem Statement

**Care market costs are unsustainable and child outcomes poor.**  

The market for children’s social care placements—that is, the accommodation and support provided to children when they are taken into the care of the local authority—has been described by the [Local Government Association](https://www.local.gov.uk/about/news/childrens-social-care-placements-costing-ps10000-plus-rise-sharply-five-years-new-lga) as “broken”. There is evidence of residential care costs increasing by c. 70% on average over the last 5 years. Further around half of children in residential care nationally are placed more than 20 miles from home.    
   
**Market intelligence is key but hard without a shared data language.**  

Managing this market – essentially ensuring that the right provision is available in the right place and at the right notice – requires market intelligence. LAs must have a clear picture of supply and demand in order to be able to tell providers what new provision they would be likely to pay for, or to make decisions about where to invest their own funds, or to guarantee payments.  

Although some solutions may be local, there is consensus that regional market coordination is key given the regional or national scale of operations of many residential providers. Regional coordination requires regional intelligence about where and what additional supply . Few regions are able to provide this currently. Although technical and legal barriers exist they are increasingly being solved. The more fundamental issue is a lack of the shared data ‘language’ between neighbouring LAs that would enable ‘like-for-like’ comparison and analysis.  

Key items like child needs, determinants of placement availability, services provided, and costs of placements tend to captured in different ways by different LAs, making it hard to answer fundamental questions about regional placement sufficiency.  

That is the problem we will tackle here – creating a data standard for describing placements which allows any region to answer its sufficiency questions, whilst placing the smallest burden on busy placement teams, and representing the smallest cost of change

## Future use cases  

Although the Steering Committee for the Standards Programme has already agreed that child placement sufficiency analysis is the initial use case we will focus on, there are a number of related use cases and expansions of this work we may wish to consider in a ‘phase 2’ of this work. For example we may wish to consider how the standard could be expanded to focus on more detailed price comparisons, on child outcomes, on contract monitoring or on adult social care cohorts (or other areas).

## What work has already been done to tackle this problem?  

Local Authorities already gather standardised statutory data (e.g. the CLA Census and SSDA903) that allows regional (or national) answers to questions like:  

* How many children are placed outside their home LA or more than 20 miles away from their home LA?   
* Which demographic characteristics are more likely to be associated with being placed far from home?   
* Which providers are being placed with most often?

Further, some regions are developing their own standardised placement cost data models to start generating regional insight into market cost trends, and many LAs are utilising software solutions like BERRI, CANs and Care Cubed to build a database of costs, placement needs and outcome data. The table below provides an overview of the data models we are aware of.

*\*Determinants of placement availability refers to factors that are likely to dictate whether a foster carer or provider are able to accept a referral and at what price. This includes things like home adaptations required, additional support requirements, risks etc.*

Although, as the table above shows, there are many models already gathering placement cost data, and some gathering other types of data necessary to meaningful regional sufficiency analysis, we are aware of none that gather all this data in a way that readily enables quantitative insight into where key sufficiency gaps are. As the table below shows, the data models we are aware of that capture rich insight on determinants of placement availability, preferred placement and child outcomes (BERRI, CANS and IMPOWER) are models designed to be used by social workers, rather than placement teams. While data of this sort gathered by social workers is invaluable for individual care planning, it is not designed primarily to support aggregate analysis or enable meaningful ‘apples for apples’ comparison with neighbours. This is because the data is largely qualitative and many key fields such as needs and risks are largely uncategorised.

## How the proposed standard has been developed  

To develop the standard, the Social Finance, in partnership with Somerset Council:  

* Reviewed existing approaches to describing needs including CANS, BERRI, and the ‘All Wales Single referral’ form as well as the definitions implied by various referral forms, framework contracts, and reporting schemas.   
* Interviewed 6 providers to understand how they define need, and how this translates into a decision on whether and at what price to offer an available placement (all other things being equal).   
* Used the above research to develop a standard for describing the needs which a placement must meet.   
* Interviewed four placement teams to understand their current processes, what data they capture, how they store it, and how data this is used (or not) in their own work and in the work of teams who they share the data on to.   
* Amended the standard considering this (to make it more practical to collect) and designed guidance on how to collect it (e.g. at what point, by whom).   
* Tested the ‘collectability’ of the standard with four teams including use on live referrals with three of them.   
* Amended the standard again to reflect lessons learned and reduce the burden on placement teams.
